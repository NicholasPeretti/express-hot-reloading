# :fire: Express-Hot-Reloading :fire:
Simple example of how implement webpack hot reloading with express.

## :warning: Disclamer
This project is WIP

## Why
I think I'm not the only one who had some issues while trying to add this
webpack feature in an existing express server.
Even following the documentation didn't work.

So I want this guide to be a working example of how to add HRM on an existing
express server.

**I'm still working on it, so stay tuned!**
